## Overview
Lab26 is a Cowsay webpage that changes it's message when you click the button on the webpage and a
new Cowsay Lorem message appears.

## Getting Started
To use the Lab26 application, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 
(Node Package manager), and [React](https://reactjs.org/)  will need
 to be locally installed.  Once Node.js, npm, have been installed, install the Lab26 
 files. Prior to starting the Lab26 application, from the command line while you are in the Lab26 file 
 folder, enter the command `npm i`.  This will download all needed dependencies for the 
 application to run.   

## Architecture
This react application was deployed with the following technologies.
Node.js, npm, body-parser, dotenv, React, Webpack, faker, babel, eslint, JavaScript
