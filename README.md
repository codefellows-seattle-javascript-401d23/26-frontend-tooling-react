## 401 JS -- Lab 26 Cowsay

I am using React to build an application that will return a cowsay image accompanied by three random words generated by faker. In addition, there is a button that when pushed, randomizes the words the cow is saying once again to generate a new phrase.

To use:

- Fork and clone this repo
- Run `npm i`
- The following changes must be made to the `balloon.js` file contained within the cowsay-browser folder inside of node_modules:
  ```
exports.say = function (text, wrap) {
	var delimiters = {
		first : ["/", "\\"],
		middle : ["|", "|"],
		last : ["\\", "/"],
		only : ["<", ">"]
	};

	return format(text, wrap, delimiters);
}

exports.think = function (text, wrap) {
	var delimiters = {
		first : ["(", ")"],
		middle : ["(", ")"],
		last : ["(", ")"],
		only : ["(", ")"]
	};

	return format(text, wrap, delimiters);
}
```
- Type `npm run watch` into the console to generate page in browser
- Click the button to view randomized phrases.
