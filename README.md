####  Documentation  
Write a description of the project in your README.md

This page renders a header which displays "Generate Cowsay Lorem", then a animal of the users specification saying a random first name generated by Faker.name.firstname(). It works by storing the animal with the name as a string in App.state.content which is generated again whenever the button reading 'click me for new content' is clicked.

#### Stretch Goal
* add a select menu that enables you to change the type of cowfile currently being used
