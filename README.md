# Project Name
**Author**: Joanna Coll
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview

This app uses React to create DOM elements through JSX. It creates a HTML object using cowsay and changes the text inside the cowsay object using faker, anytime the user clicks on the 'change moo' button.

## Getting Started

1. To start you need to install all the necessary dependencies and create all the directories.
2. Install cowsay and faker.
3. Create Sass file and change colors of the background to grey and text to white to get some contrast.
4. Create a header with greeting text.
5. Create an object that generates cowsay and use faker to generate random text.
6. Create a button to click and change the random text.


## Architecture
JavaScript, Node.js, Airbnb package, babelrc, React, cowsay, faker, other dependencies
