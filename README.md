# Frontend Tooling and React
**Author**: Sarah Bixler  
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
Click the button and select from the drop down menu to see cows and other animals say meaningless phrases in latin!

## Getting Started
- fork the repo
- npm i to install dependencies
- npm run watch to transpile and run the file from main.js

## Architecture
__babel__ for transpiling, __webpack__ for bundling, __sass__ is adding funtionality to CSS and the __React__ library is pulling it all together. 
__dotenv__ manages the environmental variables and __Eslint__ with the __airbnb__ linter is keeping it all consistent and readable on the backend.

__cowsay__ is making the magic
__faker__ is generating the ipsum.


## Change Log
05-21-2018-- app has a button to generate random strings for the 'cow' to say, and a button to change the 'cow'
