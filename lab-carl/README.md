# Lab 26 - Cowsay Intro to React

## Overview

This project is an introduction to React. The cowsay figure is updated via the state of the application. The cow text comes from content, a property on the state. The ```'Cowsay says what?'``` button updates the content state when clicked. The type of cow, think or say, is also updated via the state when the dropdown is used to select ```Cowsay-SAY``` or ```Cowsay-THINK```. I configured webpack to compile Javascript and sass into bundles. 

## Architecture

JavaScript, webpack, Babel, ESLint, sass, React, cowsay, faker.

## Getting Started

Fork and clone. In the command line, enter ```npm run watch``` to open the app in the browser.
