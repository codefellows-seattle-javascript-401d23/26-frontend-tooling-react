# Lab 26 Cowsay and introduction to React

This lab was a introduction to the set up for what is necessary to successfully launch a basic react.js application. Basic concepts such as elements, classes to hold elements and attaching elements to the DOM via rendering functions were used. State was introduced as a main concept to drive dynamic changes based on user interactivity. 

## Languages and Frameworks used
React, JSX, a lot of transpiling via babel, Webpacks, HTML and of course CSS. (mostly accomplished inline via JSX)
